            <h1>Media</h1>

            <p>Media is an umbrella term covering numerous services offered by Pez Solutions, including Plex, Jellyfin, FTP, Samba, and WebDAV. Our comprehensive media infrastructure is designed to democratize access to digital content and storage.</p>

            <p>The emphasis of this offering is leveraging our large storage capacity (~100TB) to share resources with the community. We believe data should be set free, and we want to open access to our capacity. Why hoard storage when it can benefit everyone?</p>

            <h2>Streaming Services</h2>
            <p>Access our curated media libraries through multiple streaming platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plex</strong> - Premium media streaming service with rich metadata, user management, and cross-platform compatibility. Perfect for movies, TV shows, music, and photos.</li>
                <li><strong>Jellyfin</strong> - Open-source alternative to Plex, providing complete control over your media without vendor lock-in. Fully self-hosted and privacy-focused.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>File Access & Storage</h2>
            <p>Beyond streaming, we offer direct file access through multiple protocols to suit different workflows and technical requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FTP</strong> - Traditional file transfer protocol with write access to your personal subfolder. Ideal for bulk transfers and automated workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Samba</strong> - Network file sharing that integrates seamlessly with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Mount your folder as a network drive for transparent access.</li>
                <li><strong>WebDAV</strong> - Web-based distributed authoring protocol. Access your files through any WebDAV-compatible client or directly through a web browser.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Personal Storage Space</h2>
            <p>FTP, Samba, and WebDAV services provide write access to your own designated subfolder, allowing you to store your own data in our storage infrastructure. This isn't just read-only access - you get your own private space within our massive storage pool.</p>

            <p>Whether you're backing up personal files, collaborating on projects, or need reliable storage for your digital assets, our media services provide the flexibility and capacity you need.</p>
