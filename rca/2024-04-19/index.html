            <h2>Resolution</h2>
            <p>ZFS Pool suspended due to a misaligned PCI connector on the HBA. A bent PCI bracket caused the card to tilt upwards in the back when the card was screwed in.</p>
            <p>After the card was reseated without the bracket <i>not</i> being screwed in, the pool was brought back online.</p>
            <p>1 drive from VDev 2 was in "REPAIRING" state. The drive has since stabilized and is now reporting no errors.</p>

            <h2>Corrective Actions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>HBA PCI bracket to be replaced</li>
                <li>HBA PCI bracket to be screwed in after replacement</li>
            </ul>
