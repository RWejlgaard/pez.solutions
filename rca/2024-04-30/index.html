            <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
            <p>The ZFS pool was degraded.</p>
            <p>A single disk in VDev 2 was marked as 'FAULTED'</p>

                <tr>

                    <td>18:45 BST</td>

                </tr>
                </table>

            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>
                What I think happened is that the <code>sdh</code> drive had spun down after a period of inactivity.
                ZFS was unable to wake the drive and then marked the drive as 'FAULTED' as it was unresponsive.
            </p>

            <h2>Resolution</h2>
            <p>Drive <code>sdh</code> was woken up after spinning down.</p>
            <pre>
                watch -n 1 'echo "q" | fdisk /dev/sdh'
            </pre>

            <h2>Corrective Actions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Disable sleeping (activity timeout) on all drives</li>
            </ul>
