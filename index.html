            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Pez Solutions originated as a project to optimize unused server capacity and has evolved into a sophisticated homelab environment. It serves as a platform for technological experimentation and service deployment, now operating with a focus on enterprise-grade stability and reliability.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                Our infrastructure is distributed across two primary locations: London (primary site) and Copenhagen (testing environment).<br/>
                Each location houses three servers, designated as A, B, and C, each fulfilling specific roles:<br/>
                - Server A: Dedicated to monitoring and management<br/>
                - Server B: Primary production server<br/>
                - Server C: Allocated for non-critical services and experimentation
            </p>
