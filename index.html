            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Pez Solutions is a side-project that started as a way to utilize spare server capacity.
                The project is basically my homelab - a place to experiment with different technologies and services.
                It's now run as a prod-like environment, with a focus on stability and reliability.
            </p>

            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>
                The servers are hosted in two locations: one in London (my bedroom) and one in Copenhagen.
                London is the primary location, and Copenhagen is the testing location.

                Each location has 3 servers divided into 3 different roles - A, B & C.<br/>
                A is dedicated to monitoring and management, B is the primary server, and C is for anything that's not super critical.
            </p>

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>
                Pez Solutions offers access to a Plex server and a Jellyfin server.
                All media is legally obtained.
                Both services are available to friends and family.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Access</h2>
            <p>
                To access the media servers, follow the instructions on the <a href="/how-to-connect">How to access</a>
                page.
            </p>

            <h2>Uptime & SLO</h2>
            <p>
                I aim to provide the best possible uptime, but please note that it is best efforts and not
                guaranteed.<br/>
                I'm aiming for a Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99.9% (3 nines), which means that I expect the service
                to be available for 99.9% of the time.<br />
                However, this still allows for a small amount of downtime. Based on the SLO, you can expect a maximum of
                approximately 44 minutes of downtime per month.
            </p>
