            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Pez Solutions is a company that started as a side project to utilize spare server capacity.
                It has now grown to serve over 600 movies and 200 TV shows via Plex and Jellyfin.
            </p>

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>
                Pez Solutions offers access to a Plex server and a Jellyfin server.
                Both servers are available to anyone who requests access.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Access</h2>
            <p>
                To access the media servers, follow the instructions on the <a href="/how-to-connect">How to access</a>
                page.
            </p>

            <h2>Uptime & SLO</h2>
            <p>
                Our service strives to provide the best possible uptime, but please note that it is best efforts and not
                guaranteed.<br />
                We aim for a Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99.99% (4 nines), which means that we expect the service
                to be available for 99.99% of the time.<br />
                However, this still allows for a small amount of downtime. Based on our SLO, you can expect a maximum of
                approximately 4.38 minutes of downtime per month.
            </p>
