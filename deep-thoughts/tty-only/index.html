Work Done Using Only TTY: A Journey Back to the Basics</h1>
<p>Picture this: It’s a sunny Sunday morning in 1990. You rise, brew a
fresh cup of coffee, and settle in front of the family computer. With a
flick of the power switch, the CRT monitor hums to life, degaussing into
a shaky boot sequence. Lines of text scroll down the screen, and
finally, the familiar prompt <code>C:\</code> awaits your command.</p>
<p>Do you launch into a game of Doom, or dive into a favorite bulletin
board? The choice is yours, and that nostalgia is palpable.</p>
<p>This feeling of simplicity and raw interaction is what I aim to
recapture—not in DOS, but with modern hardware.</p>
<h2 id="my-linux-journey">My Linux Journey</h2>
<p>I’ve been using Linux since the fateful day I burned a live CD of
Ubuntu 7.04 and accidentally wiped out our family PC’s Windows
partition. My distro preferences have evolved over the years: starting
from <code>Ubuntu</code>, moving to <code>Debian</code>, and
subsequently experimenting with <code>Arch</code>,
<code>Slackware</code>, <code>Gentoo</code>, and finally settling on
<code>Alpine</code>.</p>
<p>In my journey, I’ve gravitated towards the teletype console, drawn to
its rawness and simplicity. As a child, long before I could read, I was
already navigating the family computer running DOS. By memorizing the
key sequences, I could launch <code>DOOM.EXE</code> at the tender age of
four.</p>
<p>Fast forward to my teenage years, when I engaged in what I called
“TTY weekends” on a modest mid-2000s HP laptop running Debian. It was a
challenge, often requiring me to momentarily switch to a desktop
environment for quick web lookups. Yet I thrived during those weekends,
learning the ins and outs of Linux while my friends thought I’d gone off
the deep end.</p>
<p>Now, nearing my 30s and with different priorities, I find myself free
to work in ways that suit me best.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>Currently, I use a MacBook as my primary laptop, but I’ve also
acquired a ThinkPad X230 for about £30, slightly modified with a USB-C
charging port, upgraded RAM (from 4GB to 8GB), and a couple of SSDs.</p>
<p>Running Alpine Linux—renowned for its lightweight design—I’ve
automated my setup with a dotfiles installation script that configures
my fish shell, Neovim, and essential programs. It’s a streamlined setup;
if I need additional packages down the line, they can easily be
installed as needed.</p>
<h2 id="why-tty">Why TTY?</h2>
<p>When using my “normie” laptop, I often find myself ensnared by two
beasts: the web browser and the terminal. A staggering 90% of my work
falls into these categories. Given this gravitational pull towards the
terminal, I’ve grown accustomed to working within it. With Neovim as my
editor and tmux for session management, I often question why I would
waste precious CPU resources on rendering a modern UI.</p>
<p>This setup allows my Alpine installation to occupy a mere 4GB, while
my MacBook consumes over 300GB—enough space to fit my TTY configuration
in 75 times! Working in this minimalistic environment brings a sense of
zen; distractions evaporate, and simplicity reigns.</p>
<p>If I want to check the time, I simply type <code>date</code>. To view
my battery status, I run <code>batt</code>. My ThinkPad even includes an
antenna toggle, which I often leave switched off, using Wi-Fi only when
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>I feel a profound sense of control over my machine—no auto-updates,
no distractions. When I’m finished working, I’m unlikely to succumb to
YouTube rabbit holes; instead, I might tackle household chores.</p>
<h2 id="the-tty-experience">The TTY Experience</h2>
<p>Typically, I have 3-4 TTY sessions active simultaneously. I initiate
<code>cmus</code> in the first to start some music, adjust sound levels
via <code>alsamixer</code> in the second, and devote the remaining
consoles to coding with Neovim and running commands as needed.</p>
<h2 id="a-caveat-limitations">A Caveat: Limitations</h2>
<p>It’s true that not everything translates smoothly to TTY. The browser
can be a significant limitation. Think of it this way: complaining about
lack of browsing capabilities in TTY is like going to the beach and
lamenting the absence of museums. They serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with today’s capabilities for LLMs, many common
programming queries can be answered without a traditional web
browser.</p>
<h2 id="creating-custom-tools">Creating Custom Tools</h2>
<p>Accessing my machine in this way is fulfilling, yet certain tasks
have required me to create utilities to streamline my workflow. This
harkens back to earlier computing days—if a tool didn’t exist, you made
it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="custom-tools-overview">Custom Tools Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>blctl - Backlight Control</strong><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rwejlgaard/blctl">GitHub Link</a><br />
A simple program to control screen brightness without a GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>batt - Battery Information</strong><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rwejlgaard/batt">GitHub Link</a><br />
Displays current battery percentage, charging status, and wattage
in/out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sai - Stream AI</strong><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rwejlgaard/sai">GitHub Link</a><br />
Used for integrating LLMs in a manner akin to <code>sed</code> or
<code>awk</code>, allowing for simple prompts handling.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I love this setup and challenge anyone reading to give it a go for
just 24 hours. You might discover new facets of Linux, rethink your work
habits, and cultivate patience. After setting everything up, take a
moment to relish the peace and control.</p>
<p>If this minimalist approach isn’t your cup of tea, and you prefer a
more visual UI, that’s perfectly fine too. There are no judgments
here—just a personal invitation to explore.</p>
